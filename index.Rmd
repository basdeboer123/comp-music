## R Markdown

install.packages("usethis" )

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
combined_corpus %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = energy, y = danceability, color = factor(mode), size = valence)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_rug(size = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~category) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "mode", 
                     values = c("lightblue", "steelblue4"), labels = c('Minor', 'Major')) +
  theme_bw()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
